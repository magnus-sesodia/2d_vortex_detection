### **Overview**

This repository contains the models and code used for the paper: Authors, 2024 - "CNN-Based Vortex Detection in Atomic 2D Bose Gases in the Presence of a Phononic Background"

The code is provided in the form of three [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) written in Python and using the machine-learning libraries [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) & [Keras](https://keras.io/)

### **Content**

There are 3 example notebooks that cover the most important stages of the data pipeline

1. **`preprocessing.ipynb`** - Processing of the simulated data into training data
2. **`training.ipynb`** - Training and validation of the CNN
3. **`inference.ipynb`** - Predicting on experimental images

The trained model used in the paper can be found in **`models/`**
